- Note:
  Git commit always read data from "Staging Area" not from Working Area.

There three types of Areas in Git:
1. Working Area/Workspace
2. Staging Area/ Tracking Area
3. Commit Area

In Workspace 1st we need to Initialize Repository(git init) means directory, & then we "add"(Staging Area) any file that we want to commit. Without Initialize repo & without add file we unable to commit.

## Initialize Repository: [git init command]
This command for initialize repo

     git init

To check Status of update we use git status command

    git status
